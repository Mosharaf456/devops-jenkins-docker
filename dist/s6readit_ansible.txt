create your first ansible playbook
Note****: All of the Ansible playbooks are written in yml
REF: 
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html#yaml-syntax

Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, reusable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system,
one that is well suited to deploying complex applications.
If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. 
Then you can use the playbook to push out new configuration or confirm the configuration of remote systems.
